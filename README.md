## **Tetris-Basic-Master**

###  Purpose of the software 

#### Type of software development process and why

We choose Agile software development process to applied our software. The reason why we choose it is that although our software (Tetris) is a classic and traditional game, we can still add some new elements to it over time, such as high score lists and limited-time matches.

#### Usage of our software

Our product, as a light-weight casual game, is mainly for children and those who want to pass the odd time. The rules of Tetris are very simple, easy to learn, and can be ended at any time. Tetris also tests people's ability to judge and react in a short period of time, so it is very suitable for children to exercise their brain development.

#### Members

For the member who participated in software development:

| Name   | Task                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Wilson | Write the HTML file and part of the JS file |
| Kelvin | Write part of the JS file                   |
| Vivia  | Write the CSS file                          |



#### Schedule

Our timetable for developing this software is like this:

Firstly in the first week, After we have determined how to implement game functions (such as collision judgment and scoring) in Tetris, Wilson wrote the HTML file.

In the second week, when the main part of the file is about to be completed, Wilson and Kelvin discussed the programming method about the JS file. Then, when we started at JS file, With the completion of the JS file, we are constantly modifying it and the HTML file to ensure that they can be connected smoothly.

Wait until the time is up to the fourth week, on the basis that the basic functions have been realized, Vivia wrote the CSS file for this software to ensure that the software can run in good looking.

#### Current status of the software

So far, our software has implemented the basic functions (moving block, rotating block, start/pause and integration) on the PC web client. However, due to time constraints, in some special cases, there will be some minor Bugs appear in the software, which is also a problem we will overcome in the future.

####  Future plan 

For the future about our software, first of all, in order to make up for the regret caused by the lack of time, we have to modify all the bugs to ensure that it can run smoothly on the browser. Next, we plan to make a version of this software that can be run on the mobile client. After that, we will consider launching high scores and online competition functions.

###  Additional components 

####  Environments of the software development 

In this software, we use html&CSS, and JavaScript to development it.

Regarding the required equipment, our users need a PC as the required hardware, and the browser is the necessary software.*******
